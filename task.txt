Test assignment - Python
Write a program that reads from standard input and writes to standard output.
It receives data about different geometrical 2D shapes. For each of them it should calculate perimeter and area.

Sample input:
Square TopRight 1 1 Side 1
Rectangle TopRight 1 1 BottomLeft 2 2
Circle Center 1 1 Radius 2

Sample output:
Square Perimeter 1 Area 2
Rectangle Perimeter 1 Area 2
Circle Perimeter 1 Area 2

Bonus points for:
- tests
- code that is easy to extend to add more shapes
for example “Triangle Point1 5 5 Point2 8 8 Point3 10 2”
